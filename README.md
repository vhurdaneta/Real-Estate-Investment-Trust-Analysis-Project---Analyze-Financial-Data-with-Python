# Real-Estate-Investment-Trust-Analysis-Project----Skill-Path-Analyze-Financial-Data-with-Python

This project is part of the Analyze Financial Data with Python skill path of Codecademy, in this project I analyzed Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which are companies that own or operate real estate assets that generate income. REITs are similar to stocks of public companies and are traded on different stock exchanges. By investing in a REIT, you are able to invest in a portfolio of real estate assets just like I would invest in a company by buying its stock.

Using financial statistics and NumPy I analyzed two REITs: Sabra Health Care REIT Inc. (NASDAQ: SBRA), which invests in health care real estate, and Equity Residential (NASDAQ:EQR), which invests in rental apartment properties.

To complete this project, I worked in a Jupyter Notebook and followed the instructions provided to set up my project.
